# Field_Irrigation_Project
* In the irrigation project I have developed for agricultural areas, my goal is to improve the methods of using the resources we have correctly and efficiently by incorporating more automated systems. This way, we can avoid wasting water, which is one of our non-renewable resources and the essence of life. *(ALL RIGHTS RESERVED)*
